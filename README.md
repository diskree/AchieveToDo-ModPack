## How to install?

[<img src="https://github.com/modrinth/art/blob/main/Branding/Badge/badge-dark.svg"/>](https://modrinth.com/modpack/achievetodo)

To install AchieveToDo, I recommend download [the Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app). For instructions with other launchers, please see [Modrinth's documentation](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks).

# AchieveToDo

Welcome to a world where the use of every game mechanic, food, item, and block is a privilege you must earn! This is designed for those Minecraft explorers who desire a more challenging survival experience. Everything relies purely on vanilla, but with a twist - you need to unlock advancements to utilize your resources.

Each world you generate comes bundled with BlazeandCave's advancements pack, boasting 1000+ advancements. This extensive pool of advancements not only prolongs gameplay but also weaves a new layer of complexity, adding an extra dash of fun.

## World Creation

An AchieveToDo tab has been introduced to the world creation screen, featuring the following settings:

![img0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96978370/253137967-ea1ac4cb-c082-46bb-8f27-b5368b32e5a3.png)

By default, only trophies are set as rewards for advancements. However, you can enable options to receive various in-game items and increased experience for each advancement, as well as custom world generation from StardustLabs.

Before world creation, you'll be prompted to download the necessary datapacks, contingent on the settings of the world you're creating. This includes, at the very least, the main BlazeandCave's datapack. To install, simply download the file and drag and drop it into the Minecraft window. After the initial installation, the game will remember and store datapacks, so you won't have to repeat this process for each new world creation.

_Note, these settings cannot be altered once the world has been created._

_The game difficulty is automatically locked in this modpack. Make sure to select your preferred difficulty when creating the world._

## Gameplay

Your abilities within the game progressively unlock as you complete advancements. To understand what actions are available or locked, open the Blocked Actions tab in the advancements window:

![javaw_YjF99qBPO7](https://github.com/diskree/AchieveToDo/assets/96978370/641bfdd6-fa1f-4d0c-b9d3-c6442c05a0bd)

Ah, yes, it's worth noting that the tab will initially seem uninformative, filled with question marks! Idea is that you won't know a specific action is locked until you attempt it. For example, should you try to jump immediately upon spawning in the world, you'll encounter this:

![gygNGyeqmk](https://github.com/diskree/AchieveToDo/assets/96978370/1ef24d12-7c6b-48be-895f-16faa6436bb5)

Following this, the respective action will be revealed in the advancements window, allowing you to track the progress of unlocking the ability to jump:

![java_zGJlJzVvQK](https://github.com/diskree/AchieveToDo/assets/96978370/0bf08fbb-59ed-4f3f-ac3d-68f6025c884c)

And once you've successfully completed 7 advancements, the ability to jump will be unlocked, and a notification will appear to confirm this:

![java_sUcsDl9pBD](https://github.com/diskree/AchieveToDo/assets/96978370/70848bab-d72b-4341-b9c1-1e236d817de6)

## Hints

Keeping track of all you've accomplished in the world — the biomes you've visited, the items you've crafted, the mobs you've defeated — can be a daunting task. However, to combat this issue, a hint system has been developed. In the Riddle tab, I've left you a «Hintly Hallows» riddle along with a series of advancements. Inside awaits a game mechanic that presents holograms as hints for a random advancement.

The first image symbolizes the tab from which the advancement was chosen, the second stands for the advancement itself, and the third is the hint. For example, here's a hint suggesting that there is Amethyst Shard (3rd hologram) left to get the «Chromatic Armory» advancement (2nd hologram) from the Adventure tab (1st hologram):

![image](https://github.com/diskree/AchieveToDo-core/assets/96978370/6b0cc981-e600-4aa2-b851-72836bb340a0)

For advancements requiring a visit to a particular location, a special spyglass will be given instead of a hologram. Just look into it, and you will get a 3D panorama where you need to go: find a biome, visit a structure, or open a loot chest:

## Commands

`/advRandom`. Instead of manually perusing the advancements window, you can use this command to have a random, uncompleted advancement displayed in the chat. It offers a convenient way to set a personal objective without taking your attention away from the gameplay. However, advancements that require progress or are notably difficult will not be included in the suggestions.

## Advancement Window

For enhanced convenience, the advancements window has been expanded to fill the entire screen. Furthermore, the tabs are meticulously organized - they are grouped by their relevance and positioned uniformly on all four sides of the window, maintaining a consistent offset. There is also a search for advancements by name or description.

# Acknowledgments

- This marks my first major project in Minecraft modding. In fact, it wouldn't have been possible without [Cavinator1](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/cavinator1)'s creation of the [BlazeandCave's advancement pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blazeandcave-s-advancements-pack-1-12), which served as a significant inspiration for me.
- I extend my gratitude to the [StardustLabs](https://www.stardustlabs.net) team for their world generation contribution for all three dimensions.
- This modpack is based on 💜 [Sugar Optimization](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sugar) modpack. I express my appreciation for the exceptional work put into optimizing and enhancing the Minecraft experience!
