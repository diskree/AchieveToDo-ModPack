Thank you for downloading this datapack!
If you liked or have any ideas for other advancements that could be added to this datapack (or found any issues) feel free to comment.

Please use Minecraft 1.19.1, 1.19.2 or 1.19.3 for this version.
The datapack may or may not continue to work properly in future versions. Please make a backup of your world before attempting to use in future versions in case of bugs.

--- Installing ---
1) Unzip the compressed folder that you downloaded. Inside should be this read me document and a folder labeled "bac_advancements"

2) 
- For a new world: You can click the "Data Packs" option when creating a new world. Upon doing this, either open the world folder and copy in the "bac_advancements" folder, or click and drag the "bac_advancements" folder directly into the menu. Once it is imported, mouse over the icon for BlazeandCave's advancements pack so an arrow appears, then click the arrow to load the datapack.
- For an existing world: Copy the folder labelled "BlazeandCave's Advancements Pack" (which is then followed by its version number). Paste it into the following folder directory in the world you want to install them in: <World name>/datapacks.

3) Go into the world. A message should pop up saying you are using BlazeandCave's advancements pack. If not, check your advancements menu. You should see the custom tab named "BlazeandCave's Advancements"
If you forgot to load the datapack when creating from a new world, type the command: /datapack enable "file/bac_advancements"
